## R Markdown

Relevant Information:
The Powerball lottery was loaded into MySQL DB and describes Powerball winning numbers over a period of Feb 3rd to the present. 
(1) Created a MySQL database that includes all of the information above. - CHOSE to load to MySQL and use the lesson from homework 2 to create DB.
(2) Read the information from your .CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy
and transform your data.
(3) Perform analysis to compare the numbers in the various position of the powerball winning number.
(4) Code will be in an R Markdown file, posted to rpubs.com, and will include narrative
descriptions of your data cleanup work, analysis, and conclusions. We will include in our
project submission:
The URL to the .Rmd file in your GitHub repository. and
The URL for your rpubs.com web page.

# load csv into mem for ad hoc EDA. 
##### NC note: happy to host the mysql db in my aws and share pw via lastpass so we can mutually reference a common table.
```{r}
raw_data <- read.csv("powerball.csv", sep = ",", header = FALSE)
#nrow(raw_data)
#?na.omit
nrow(na.omit(raw_data))
head(raw_data)
```

# initial observations on state of raw data:
* we know that there is variance in header count, where data from 2012 to 2014 has one less header "Power Play"
* rows that represent drawings from 2012 to 2014 have value "0" where header is "Power Play" / column position is 11
* column 1 is not useful

# scrape table with estimated jackpot winnings
```{r}
library(xml2)
library(rvest)
url <- "https://www.txlottery.org/export/sites/lottery/Games/Powerball/Winning_Numbers/print.html_2013354932.html"
winnings <- xml2::read_html(url)
winnings <- rvest::html_table(winnings)[[1]]
nrow(na.omit(raw_data))
head(winnings)
```

# observations on both data sets collected so far:
* after omitting rows with missing data, there is row count parity
* "estimated jackpot" column contains values that require transformation into numeric representation
* "jackpot option" column contains "CVO" value, which indicates whether the winner took the lump sum over annual payments
* "winning numbers" column headers will require transformation in unique values by position
* in "jackpot winners" column, value "roll" indicates a roll-over, where no winner was selected (ref: https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110429210210AA8Y824&guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZWNvc2lhLm9yZy8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAB6jQ-NGhdyMOMlFbNTSrqAgIkL-1JtAQoQyaGrwCWYspY8f3mDVzHJjsZ0enRMo17Ww9cYAzc2fmAKhcEkhTGArfXiiOZfMk1Du9658VBZZg5ZU8MjAsbaLY15qkJ4zaGU10aXtW5Fqm0qsgJvVSsPIX5_CI5veEM03FoI_h1lC). 
* where "jackpot option" value is "CVO", it is also possible to spot a value indicating the number of "jackpot winners"

# list of potential questions we can ask / potential visualizations
* likelihood of "out of state winner" vs presumably "in state winner"
* average number of rolls and time between winners, grouped by type of winner
* how has growth of jackpot size between wins changed over time?
* distribution of numbers (how "random"/normally distributed is number selection?)
